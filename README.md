## Instructions

For this assignment, you will write a program to implement an encoder that receives binary data and produces the encoded data as a digital signal using the digital encoding techniques listed below. Assume that the reference value is negative for all the encoding techniques (same as in Figure 5.2). The result of running your program should be a digital waveform. You can produce this output using either text with a + sign indicating a positive signal, a _ indicating no signal, and a – sign indicating a negative signal. If your program produces this output in graphical form, you may receive bonus points. You may work in a group of 2–3 students but, if you work in a group, I will expect you to turn in a higher quality assignment.
